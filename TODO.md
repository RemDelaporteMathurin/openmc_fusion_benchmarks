# to do
- ease the plot
- divide by volume
- get relative std dev

## test

## notebooks
- how to navigate the .h5 files
- how to generate a new .h5 
- how to get code version/nuclear data file, where, when and DOI of experiment

## clean postprocessing
- being able to extract tally from statepoint files
- pick tally from database
- mean, std_dev, rel_std_dev, ratio_of_means

## plots
