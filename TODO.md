# to do
- the to_hdf method should be revised: one should be able to provide the "when" and "where" and a default hdf_file name should be added, think about the xaxis thing as well (?)
- the to_hdf file should be more resilient to errors

## test

## notebooks
- how to generate a new .h5 

## clean postprocessing
- being able to extract tally from statepoint files
- pick tally from database
- mean, std_dev, rel_std_dev, ratio_of_means
